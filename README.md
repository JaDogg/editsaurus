# Writing Check

## Overview

The purpose of this tool is to highlight potential writing pitfalls and encourage good habits. It has options to check a writing sample for adverbs, filler words, passive voice, lexical illusions, commonly misused words, and pronouns for clarity. 

It outputs the writing sample with each of the checked options highlighted where appropriate. 

The article [3 shell scripts to improve your writing, or "My Ph.D. advisor rewrote himself in bash." by Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/) inspired this website. I have expanded on it to include other things I thought would be helpful. 

## Future Features

There are some addtional features I would like to implement in the future if I get the time. The list includes:

* character/word/sentence/syllable count
* average chacacters/syllables per word
* average words per sentence
* Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease test
* various grade level reading tests
* rebuild using angular for on the live updates without submitting
* make output text editable
