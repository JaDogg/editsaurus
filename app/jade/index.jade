						h2 Adverbs
						ul
							li -ly
						p Adverbs are used to modify another word. Adverbs are often unneeded. The adverb and the word it modifies can be replaced by a stronger word or the adverb can be ommitted without losing anything.

					div.filler-words-description.description
						h2 Filler Words
						ul
							li very, several, many, most, few, vast, just, quite, often, various, a number of
						p These words can usually be ommitted. They often do not add anything of value to the writing other than word count. Ommitting them can tighten up your writing.

					div.passive-voice-description.description
						h2 Passive Voice
						ul
							li (is, isn't, are, aren't, am, am not, was, wasn't, were, weren't, had, hadn't, has been, have been, had been, will be, being) + past particle
						p These words can be indicators of passive voice. Passive voice occurs when you make the object of action into the subject of a sentence. 
						p Passive voice is not always bad but it can affect the clarity or weaken the impact of a sentence. It can often be replaced with an active sentence structure to improve the writing.

					div.lexical-illusions-description.description
						h2 Lexical Illusions
						ul
							li duplicate words
						p Lexical illusions are words duplicate words at a line break that are often missed when reading or editing copy because our brains will automatically ignore the second instance.

					div.misused-words-description.description
						h2 Commonly Misused Words
						ul
							li their, they're, there, your, you're, its, it's, whose, who's
						p These words are often misused. Double check them to make sure you used the correct word in each case. 

					div.pronoun-description.description
						h2 Pronouns
						ul
							li he, she, it
						p This test highlights pronouns so you can make sure there are not too many too close toghether and that it is clear who or what each one is referring to.

					h2 About

					p The purpose of this website is to highlight potential pitfalls in your writing and encourage good habits. Few of the things this tool highlights are hard and fast rules that must be followed. Try to look at the output as a chance to think about your writing choices and see if there are areas for improvement.

					p This website is not infallible. It is bound to miss a few things and there will be some false positives on the results from time to time. This is not a replacement for careful editing. That said, I do hope this provides some useful feedback to you. 

					p This website was originally inspired by the article #[a(href='http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/') 3 shell scripts to improve your writing, or "My Ph.D. advisor rewrote himself in bash." by Matt Might] and expanded on to include some other things that I thought would be helpful.
